Please create a custom landing page with custom form (not in HubSpot) that submits to a server side script. This script then submits to the contact data to your personal HubSpot portal. The landing page and script can be hosted anywhere you want, locally is fine but if you can make it publicly accessible, that's bonus points.  The end result should be:

a contact record is created with
page views and form submissions in their contact timeline,
and of course contact properties are properly filled out  
The tech stack you choose is not important, but practical knowledge of our APIs to help troubleshoot prospects' problems in integrating is another thing we do regularly.  Free feel to go beyond the baseline objectives of the exercise to implement other tech-bits that enhance the user-experience or marketing performance of this simple exercise, such as

form validation
responsive design
If you have any questions don't hesitate to reach out to Zack.  We would much rather you ask any questions you have and he can help (or choose not to :)) rather than have you be in the dark and miss the chance to really show us what you have.

Good luck!
